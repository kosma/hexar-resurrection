# Konica Hexar AF Reverse Engineering Project

Reverse-engineered design documents for Konica Hexar AF.
This perpetual work in progress is centered around several aspects of the camera:

1. Acquiring enough knowledge to aid in successful repair of the electronics.
2. Reconstructing a full schematic of the camera to aid in debugging.
3. Reconstructing a full PCB design of the camera to be able to remanufacture it
   in case the leaky capacitor corrosion makes it impossible to repair the flex PCB.

## Schematics & PCB

Use [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) to open the schematics/PCB. The program is free to use.

## Public Service Announcement

All Hexars require **URGENT** replacement of capacitors. If done *before* they start to leak,
this is a simple procedure that can be done by any skilled electronics technician.
If done *after* they start to leak, there is a significant chance of the corrosion
progressing to the point where the flex will require significant expensive and difficult repair.

THIS IS NOT A DRILL. Take your Hexar to an electronics repair shop NOW.
Replace the capacitors before your beautiful camera becomes a sad paperweight.
